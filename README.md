# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The background and overview of the project is that we are expecting a very large number of employees to be retiring very soon and we need to plan for their retirement to make sure we are prepared to backfill their positions as well as have more junior staff trained and mentored in a way that they are ready to step into those roles.  We also need to understand the expected number of retirees by department and level so we can develop a plan for filling those positions as we don't know if the expected retirees are concentrated in certain departments or at certain levels.  
## Results

A.  Deliverable 1:  The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
1.  The first deliverable (as shown in the image below), which is the number of retiring employees by title, shows that the expected retirees are concentrated in the engineer level, 36,291/72,458, which is 50% of total expected retirees.
2.  There are very limited number of manager retirees, with only 2 expected retirees at the manager level.
3.

B.  Deliverable 2:  The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program:
1.  The second deliverable (as shown below), Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program, assumes that the only employees eligible for the mentorship program are those born in 1965, which is only 1550 employees. 
2.  I would recommend that we expand the birth date of employees eligible for the mentorship program so that we can ensure we are preparing our workforce for the future and preparing them for future positions in the organization.

##Summary:
Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?  72,458 roles will need to be filled as those are the expected total number of retirees.  
2.  Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?  There are enough mentors available to train engineers and staff as well as technical leaders.
3.  While it does not appear that there are many managers who will be retiring, only 2, it appears that there are most likely already a large number of managers that are not near retirement age.  
4.  While there isn't a current issue with managers retiring soon, we should perform an additional analysis to analyze the current age of managers in order to anticipate and plan for the future in the manager area.  
5.  There may also be roles that exist in the organization that are not currently listed on our "retiring.titles" spreadsheet, so there are other roles that may need mentoring.  We will need to understand all of the roles that exist and develop and appropriate action plan for mentorship.
